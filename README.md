# Data-Science-ANZ-Virtual-Experience-Program

Virtual internship experience offered by ANZ through InsideSherpa as a part of their Data@ANZ program, which provides some insights into the sort of work the data science team at ANZ do.
This includes two modules:

Task 1 - Used Pandas to segregate customer data by each month and used Matplotlib to visualise transaction volume and mean transaction amount each day.

Task 2 - Linear regression model - used card present flag, merchant code, balance, age and amount from grouped data set to predict annual salary, obtained test prediction accuracy of -0.32. Reverting back to original data set, created dummy variables for categorical variables including gender and age. Decision tree classifier and regression models - used modified data set to predict annual salary, obtained test scores of 0.76 and 0.67 respectively.
